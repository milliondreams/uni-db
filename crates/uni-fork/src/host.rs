//! Host traits that invert the dependency between the fork diff/promote

//!
//! The diff/promote logic needs to run Cypher queries against a session, read
//! the storage manager's UID indexes, and bulk-insert promoted rows into a
//! primary transaction. All of those are uni-db types, so the engine is made
//! generic over these traits and uni-db supplies the implementations
//! (`Session: ForkQueryHost`, `Transaction: ForkPromoteSink`).
