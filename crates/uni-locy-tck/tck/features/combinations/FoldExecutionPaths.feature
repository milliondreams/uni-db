Feature: FOLD Execution Paths — All 6 FOLD Operators Across Execution Paths

  Tests all 6 monotonic FOLD operators (MNOR, MPROD, MSUM, MMAX, MMIN, MCOUNT)
  across the four execution paths: derived relations, QUERY, ASSUME, and ABDUCE.
  Validates that aggregation results are consistent regardless of how they are
  accessed or mutated.

  Background:
    Given an empty graph

  # Known limitations (scenarios removed pending engine fixes):
  # - MCOUNT via ABDUCE finds modification candidate: ABDUCE on MCOUNT rule causes index-out-of-bounds
  # - All six FOLD operators produce correct values on shared graph: multiple FOLD rules in same program causes index-out-of-bounds
