Feature: Exact BDD-based Probability Computation
  When exact_probability is enabled, shared-proof groups use BDD-based
  computation instead of the independence assumption. This produces correct
  results for MNOR/MPROD when proof paths share base facts.

  Background:
    Given an empty graph

  # ── BDD corrects shared-proof diamond ──────────────────────────────────
  # Two paths in a recursive reach rule (Source→Mid→Target and Source→Target).
  # MNOR folds over e.p values: Rule 1 contributes 0.7 (direct), Rule 2
  # contributes 0.3 (first-hop edge). Independence MNOR: 1-(1-0.7)(1-0.3)=0.79.
  # With exact_probability, a SharedProbabilisticDependency warning is emitted.

  Scenario: Shared-proof diamond with exact_probability produces correct result
