Feature: Top-K Proof Filtering (Scallop, Huang et al. 2021)

  Tests that top_k_proofs bounds the number of proof annotations retained
  per derived fact, keeping only the highest-probability proof paths.

  Background:
    Given an empty graph

  Scenario: Default unlimited retains all proofs — backward compatible
    Given having executed:
      """
      CREATE (a:Node {name: 'A'})-[:LINK {p: 0.9}]->(b:Node {name: 'B'}),
             (a)-[:LINK {p: 0.5}]->(c:Node {name: 'C'}),
             (c)-[:LINK {p: 0.8}]->(b)

        YIELD KEY x, KEY y, prob
      """
    Then evaluation should succeed
    And the derived relation 'reach' should have 3 facts
