Feature: Phase B A3 — Candle-backed neural classifier

  Validates that a real `CandleLinearClassifier` (single-layer
  logistic regression, weights loaded from safetensors at scenario
  setup) drives a Locy rule's PROB output end-to-end. Closes the
  Phase B gate "Real Candle classifier loads + invokes via mock-
  config TCK harness".

  Each scenario uses a deterministic fixture with weight=4.394 and
  bias=-2.197, chosen so that:
    * sigmoid(weight * 1.0 + bias) = sigmoid(2.197) ≈ 0.9
    * sigmoid(weight * 0.0 + bias) = sigmoid(-2.197) ≈ 0.1

  Background:
    Given an empty graph

  Scenario: Candle classifier with missing feature uses bias-only sigmoid
    # The customer has no `score` property — `extract_feature_value`
    # returns Null, the classifier encodes it as 0.0, and the output
    # is sigmoid(bias) ≈ 0.1. Documents the missing-feature contract.
