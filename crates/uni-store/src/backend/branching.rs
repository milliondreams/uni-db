//! Backend-neutral fork branching abstraction.
//!
//! Forks need copy-on-write isolation over a set of tables: a child branch that
//! reads through to its parent for untouched rows and shadows it for its own
//! writes. Lance provides this natively via branches plus the `base_paths`
//! chain, and until now the fork engine called `backend::lance_branch`'s free
//! functions directly — which made forking structurally unavailable to any
//! other backend and leaked `*.lance` URI construction as far up as
//! `crates/uni/src/api/fork.rs`.
//!
//! [`ForkBranching`] is that capability expressed in backend-neutral terms.
//! Two deliberate differences from the `lance_branch` free functions it
//! replaces:
//!
//! - **Logical table names, not dataset URIs.** Every method takes a table
//!   name; resolving it to physical storage is the implementation's job. This
//!   is what removes the duplicated `format!("{base}/{table}.lance")` from
//!   `BranchedBackend` and from `crates/uni`.
//! - **`Vec<RecordBatch>` + an explicit schema**, matching
//!   [`StorageBackend::replace_table_atomic`]. The free functions took a
//!   generic `R: RecordBatchReader`, which is not object-safe; the schema must
//!   travel separately because an empty batch vector carries none, and branch
//!   creation needs a schema precisely in that case.
//!
//! A backend without copy-on-write branching simply returns `None` from
//! [`StorageBackend::branching`], and forks are unavailable rather than
//! silently incorrect.
//!
//! [`StorageBackend::replace_table_atomic`]: super::traits::StorageBackend::replace_table_atomic

/// - **Reads on a branch must fuse.** A scan of `branch` is required to
///   surface both the branch's own rows and those inherited from its parent.
/// - **Versions are opaque monotonic counters.** Callers only ever pass a
///   value previously returned by [`Self::current_version`] or
///   [`Self::current_version_on_branch`] back into a create call.
