//! Reconcile a write batch's schema against the table it is about to hit.
//!
//! uni builds a flush batch's Arrow schema from the *declared catalog
//! properties* — [`VertexDataset::get_arrow_schema`] and its delta twin read
//! `schema.properties` and never consult the dataset. Declaring a property on
//! a label that already has flushed data therefore produces a batch carrying a
//! column the dataset has never had, which Lance rejects:
//!
//! ```text
//! Append with different schema: fields did not match,
//! missing=[], unexpected=[added_later]
//! ```
//!
//! The rejection happens in the flush's *stream* phase, so the rotated L0 is
//! never completed or truncated: it stays on `pending_flush`, nothing
//! re-flushes it, and the automatic path logs the failure as
//! `"(non-critical)"`. The label is wedged permanently and survives reopen.
//! That is issue #249.
//!
//! Dropping a property is the mirror case. Lance tolerates a column *missing*
//! from an appended batch only when the **stored** field is nullable
//! (`allow_missing_if_nullable && expected_field.nullable`), and
//! `SchemaBuilder::property` defaults to `NOT NULL` — so a dropped property
//! wedges the table with `missing=[p], unexpected=[]`.
//!
//! [`ensure_table_accepts`] closes both by widening the stored schema before
//! the write. It is deliberately placed in the two shared write helpers in
//! [`crate::storage::manager`] rather than at the DDL sites, because the
//! backend there is polymorphic: the same call covers primary, forks, the
//! fork branch-creation race, and fork-local schema overlays that no
//! primary-side pass can see.
