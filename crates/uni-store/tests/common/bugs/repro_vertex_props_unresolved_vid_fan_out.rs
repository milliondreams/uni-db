//! `PropertyManager::get_batch_vertex_props` scans *every declared label* as
//! soon as a single vid in the batch fails to resolve.
//!
//! The label set to scan is chosen at `property_manager.rs:540-555`: each vid is
//! looked up in the `VidLabelsIndex`, and the first one that misses `break`s out
//! and falls back to `schema.labels.keys()` — "Fallback to full scan". The
//! escalation is all-or-nothing and batch-wide: one unresolved vid among a
//! hundred resolved ones costs the whole batch a fan-out across every label.
//!
//! # What makes a vid unresolved
//!
//! `update_vid_labels_index` has exactly one production caller
//! (`writer.rs:5344`), inside `flush_to_l1`, and the startup rebuild reads the
//! *main vertex table*. So the index describes flushed vertices only, and a
//! vertex that has been written but not yet flushed is absent from it — which
//! makes the ordinary insert-then-read sequence the trigger, not an edge case.
//!
//! This is the vertex-side sibling of #222, but it is **not** the same trigger:
//! #222's edge fan-out fires when L0 is *cold*, this one fires when L0 is *hot*.
//!
//! # These asserted the defect, and now assert the fix
//!
//! They were written `#[ignore]`d, pinning the *defective* counts so a fix
//! could land without appearing to break CI, with a note that the fix should
//! update the expected counts rather than delete the tests. That is what
//! happened: `get_batch_vertex_props` now consults L0 for the labels the index
//! is missing, so the counts below are the ones the batch actually needs and
//! the tests gate the default run.
//!
//! Measured across the change, on the 8-label fixture:
//!
//! | batch | before | after |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 1 resolved vid | 1 | 1 |
//! | 1 unflushed vid | 8 | **1** |
//! | 2 resolved + 1 unflushed | 8 | **2** |
//!
//! The third row is the one that shows the `break` mattered: the two resolved
//! vids used to be dragged to the full fan-out by the third.
//!
//! # Why the assertion is a contrast, not a threshold
//!
//! The answers are identical either way — the unflushed vertex is served from
//! the L0 overlay regardless of how many label datasets were scanned — so no
//! correctness test can distinguish the two shapes and the guard has to be a
//! count. A bare "scans == LABELS" would also pass if the counter broke and both
//! arms went to zero, so each test below runs the resolved arm as its control
//! and compares.
