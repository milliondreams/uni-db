//! Phase 0B — instruction-count qualification pilot.
//!
//! This is **not** a perf gate. It is the pilot that decides which hot paths
//! *can* be gated on instruction counts at all, per
//! `docs/proposals/test_harness_implementation_plan_2026-08-12.md` §0B.
//!
//! # Why instruction counts
//!
//! GitHub-hosted runners vary ±20–30% run to run, so a wall-clock gate at any
//! useful threshold either fires constantly and gets disabled, or is set so
//! loose it catches nothing. Instruction counts under Callgrind are
//! deterministic to ~0.1% on the same noisy hardware.
//!
//! # Why a pilot rather than a gate
//!
//! Instruction counts miss I/O, cache effects and parallelism. A flush that does
//! the same work with worse locality regresses badly at a flat instruction
//! count; a commit dominated by `fsync` shows instruction noise with no
//! wall-clock meaning. Gating such a target is worse than not gating it, because
//! it trains everyone to ignore the gate.
//!
//! So all seven candidates are instrumented here, and only those that prove both
//! **stable** (CV < 1%) and **CPU-dominant** (instruction delta tracks
//! wall-clock delta under injected regressions) graduate to
//! `docs/perf/iai-qualification-*.md` and, later, to the Phase-7 gate. The
//! per-target `EXPECT` note on each function is the prior being tested, not a
//! conclusion.
//!
//! # The measured region is bounded by *instrumentation*, not collection
//!
//! Callgrind has two independent switches, and the difference between them is
//! load-bearing here:
//!
//! * **Collection** (`--collect-atstart`, `--toggle-collect`) is **per-thread**.
//!   The default iai-callgrind setup toggles collection on entry to the
//!   benchmark function, so only the thread that enters it ever collects.
//! * **Instrumentation** (`--instr-atstart`,
//!   `CALLGRIND_{START,STOP}_INSTRUMENTATION`) is **process-global**.
//!
//! These targets do a large and growing share of their work off the calling
//! thread — `lance_core::utils::tokio::spawn_cpu` dispatches onto tokio's
//! blocking pool — so a per-thread collection toggle cannot see it. Measured
//! 2026-09-16: under the old toggle-based setup, `vertex_lookup_by_id`
//! attributed **7,895 Ir** to a query whose real all-thread cost is
//! **7,392,263 Ir** — 0.1%. Worse, the share that escaped grew with a
//! dependency bump (lance 7→11 / DataFusion 53→54), so the five read targets
//! collapsed to within a few percent of `baseline_session_only` and the gate
//! read a ~96% "improvement" for code that got 2.8% *cheaper*.
//!
//! So: run with `--instr-atstart=no --collect-atstart=yes` and
//! [`EntryPoint::None`], and bound each target with [`measured`], which flips
//! instrumentation on and off around the work. Every thread is then counted,
//! and only for the region under test. `iai_collect.py` already sums the
//! per-thread `callgrind.*.tNN.*.out` files and reports the off-main-thread
//! share, so a regression to per-thread blindness shows up as `off-thr %`
//! falling back to 0.
//!
//! Two consequences worth knowing:
//!
//! * Fixture construction now runs **uninstrumented** rather than merely
//!   uncollected, so the pilot is markedly faster — Valgrind's 10–50×
//!   multiplier no longer applies to setup.
//! * `stop_instrumentation` flushes Valgrind's simulated cache, so the D1/LL
//!   figures `iai_collect.py` also records carry an artificial warm-up. The
//!   gate is on `Ir`, which is unaffected; do not build a cache-miss gate on
//!   these numbers without revisiting this.
//!
//! Fixtures are correspondingly small — this measures repeatability of a metric,
//! not throughput at scale.
//!
//! Run with (requires `valgrind` and a matching `iai-callgrind-runner`):
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo bench -p uni-db --bench hot_paths_iai
//! ```
