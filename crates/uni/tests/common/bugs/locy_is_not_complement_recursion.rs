//! Regression: Locy `IS NOT` complement must stay correct when a FOLD rule and a
//! recursive rule coexist and the recursive relation exceeds the
//! `DEDUP_ANTI_JOIN_THRESHOLD` (300 facts).
//!
//! Distilled from the flagship predictive-maintenance notebook
//! (`website/docs/examples/python/locy_predictive_maintenance.ipynb`), whose
//! `HEALTHY_ASSETS_COUNT` assertion failed: `healthy_assets` (the complement of
//! `failure_prone`) derived 0 rows instead of 30.
//!
//! ## Root cause (fixed)
//!
//! The semi-naive fixpoint switches its delta-dedup strategy once a rule's fact
//! set reaches `DEDUP_ANTI_JOIN_THRESHOLD` (300). Above the threshold it used a
//! `LeftAnti` hash join (`arrow_left_anti_dedup`), which removes candidate rows
//! matching *existing* facts but did **not** dedup duplicate rows *within* a
//! single iteration's candidate batch — unlike the `RowDedupState` / legacy paths
//! used below the threshold. A transitive-closure rule emits the same `(a, b)`
//! pair via every intermediate `mid`, so above 300 facts the relation exploded
//! (here `58_050` rows for a `1_350`-pair closure). That bloated, with FOLD's
//! provenance tracking active, pushed the recursive stratum past the 300 s program
//! timeout, after which the remaining stratum (`healthy_assets`) was skipped —
//! silently yielding 0 rows. The fix makes `arrow_left_anti_dedup` dedup within
//! the candidate set, restoring set semantics across the threshold.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   cargo nextest run -p uni-db --test bugs \
//!     -E 'test(locy_is_not_complement_partitions_fleet_with_fold_and_recursion)'
