//! A variable-length pattern with no written upper bound is planned with a
//! default of 100 hops, and truncating at that bound must say so.
//!
//! The two safety caps inside the search (`MAX_FRONTIER_SIZE`,
//! `MAX_PRED_POOL_SIZE`) already push a `QueryWarning` when they abandon a
//! traversal, precisely because results that look complete and are not are the
//! worst kind of answer. The planner-supplied hop ceiling has the same
//! consequence and was silent: on a 150-vertex chain,
//! `MATCH p = (a)-[:R*]->(b)` returned 100 paths with a maximum length of 100 —
//! the true longest being 149 — and an empty `warnings` list.
//!
//! The noise half matters as much as the signal half. A warning that fires on
//! ordinary bounded traversals trains people to ignore the channel, so the
//! quiet cases are asserted just as hard as the loud one.

// Rust guideline compliant
