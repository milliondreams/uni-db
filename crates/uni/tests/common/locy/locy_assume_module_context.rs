//! Runtime companion to `uni-locy`'s `repro_assume_body_outer_rule_ref`.
//!
//! Compiling is not the bar here. `CompiledAssume` carries a `body_program`
//! whose `rule_catalog` is separate from the parent's, and the body's commands
//! look rules up **unqualified, straight from the AST** — `locy_assume.rs` and
//! `locy_query.rs` both do `program.rule_catalog.get(&rule_name)`. So a fix
//! that made the body's own rules module-qualified would compile cleanly and
//! then fail at run time with "rule not found".
//!
//! Running these end to end revealed a second, independent layer: the body's
//! rules are compiled as their own program, so its plan build saw only the
//! body's `rule_catalog` and an IS-reference to an outer rule failed with
//! `IS-reference to unknown rule` — in the no-`MODULE` control too, which
//! compiles cleanly. The feature had never worked at runtime, module or not.
//!
//! Both layers are fixed now. The compiler makes outer rules *visible* to the
//! body (under both their qualified and bare spellings), and the runtime merges
//! the parent's catalog with the body's before planning the body's strata and
//! before dispatching its commands — with body-local rules shadowing.
