//!
//! `WHERE x IS NOT some_rule` silently does not filter — every row is returned,
//! with no error and no warning.
//!
//! ## The issue's stated trigger is wrong
//!
//! The report attributes the failure to `x` "not being a KEY column". Measured
//! behaviour (the matrix below) shows KEY-ness is irrelevant:
//!
//! | consuming rule's YIELD    | negated subject | filters? |
//! |---------------------------|-----------------|----------|
//! | `YIELD KEY b, a`          | `a`             | yes      |
//! | `YIELD KEY b, KEY a AS s` | `s`             | yes      |
//! | `YIELD KEY b, a AS s`     | `s`             | yes      |
//! | `YIELD KEY b, a AS s`     | `a`             | **no**   |
//! | `YIELD KEY b`             | `a`             | **no**   |
//!
//! A *non*-KEY column filtered correctly (row 1) and a *KEY* column failed once
//! aliased (row 4). The real predicate was purely name-based: did a column with
//! that exact name exist in the rule's **projected output**? All five rows now
//! filter.
//!
//! ## Root cause (FIXED)
//!
//! Two independent faults composed.
//!
//! 1. **Phase ordering.** The anti-join runs *after* `LocyProject`
//!    (`Body(yield + positive IS) -> IS NOT(anti-join) -> PROB -> post-fixpoint`),
//!    and `LocyProject` emits exactly the YIELD names. A variable bound in
//!    MATCH but not yielded — or yielded under an alias — no longer existed as
//!    a column by the time the negation was evaluated. The user writes `WHERE`
//!    as scoping over MATCH variables; it was implemented as scoping over
//!    projection outputs. `issue_158_positive_is_ref_is_unaffected` pins the
//!    asymmetry that gave this away: the *positive* `IS` form resolves the same
//!    subject correctly, because it runs inside the body plan.
//!
//! 2. **Fail-open degradation.** Given an unresolvable column, the anti-join
//!    emitted precisely the rows it was asked to exclude — silent, and in the
//!    security-relevant direction. The originating report describes a
//!    tax-exemption guard (`WHERE c IS NOT exempt_customer`) with no effect at
//!    all.
//!
//! Fault 2 was closed first (unresolvable subjects became a hard error). Fault
//! 1 is closed by projecting a hidden `{var}._vid` column for every negated
//! subject that is a MATCH-bound node variable, so resolution keys on node
//! identity rather than on whatever YIELD chose to call things — see
//! `LocyIsRef::subject_vid_cols` and `strip_isnot_vid_columns`.
//!
//! Subjects that are *not* MATCH-bound node variables have no `._vid` column
//! (relationship variables expose `._eid`; scalar subjects have neither), so
//! they cannot key an anti-join that joins on node identity. Those are now
//! **rejected at compile time** by `LocyCompileError::IsNotSubjectNotANode`,
//! rather than reaching the runtime error Wave 0 introduced — pinned by
//! `issue_158_non_node_subject_is_rejected_rather_than_failing_open`.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   cargo nextest run -p uni-db --test integration -E 'test(issue_158)'

// Rust guideline compliant
