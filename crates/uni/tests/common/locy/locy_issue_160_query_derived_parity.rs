//! Repro for <https://github.com/rustic-ai/uni-db/issues/160>
//!
//! In a single Locy evaluation, `result.derived[r]` holds facts while the
//! corresponding `QUERY r` yields zero rows. `QUERY` is the documented
//! interactive entry point, so the failure mode is an ad-hoc query silently
//! reporting "nothing found" about data that does contain matches.
//!
//! ## The issue's stated trigger is wrong
//!
//! The report requires a "multi-level derivation chain whose base is recursive"
//! and states that querying the recursive rule directly does not reproduce.
//! Measured behaviour contradicts both claims:
//!
//! | shape                                      | derived | QUERY |
//! |--------------------------------------------|---------|-------|
//! | recursive rule queried directly            | 3       | **2** |
//! | one level above it                         | 1       | **0** |
//! | two levels, two IS-refs                    | 1       | **0** |
//! | two levels, one IS-ref                     | 1       | **0** |
//! | two IS-refs over a **non**-recursive base  | 1       | **0** |
//!
//! Isolating the variable shows the real trigger is neither depth, recursion,
//! nor repeated refs, but whether an `IS`-ref **introduces a variable binding
//! that the MATCH pattern does not already provide**:
//!
//! | `(r, p) IS rp` with `p` bound in MATCH     | derived 1 | QUERY 1 |
//! | `(r, p) IS rp` with `p` introduced by ref  | derived 1 | QUERY 0 |
//!
//! The recursive case only looks special because its recursive clause
//! (`WHERE (parent, p) IS role_perm`) happens to introduce `p`.
//!
//! ## Root cause (FIXED)
//!
//! `derived` and `QUERY` are served by two different engines.
//!
//! `derived` comes from the DataFusion semi-naive fixpoint's `DerivedStore`
//! (`uni/src/api/impl_locy.rs:878-911`). `QUERY` goes through a top-down SLG
//! resolver that discards the converged facts and re-derives from scratch:
//! `uni-query/src/query/df_graph/locy_query.rs:72-87` seeds a fresh `RowStore`
//! with **FOLD rules only**. The SLG path then runs the Cypher MATCH first and
//! applies `IS`-refs as a *filter* over the resulting rows
//! (`locy_delta.rs:74-108`, `:249`) — it can check an already-bound subject but
//! has no mechanism to *bind* a fresh one from a derived fact, so fresh-binding
//! refs match nothing and the row is dropped.
//!
//! The bottom-up engine implements the full language; the top-down engine
//! implemented a strictly weaker subset, and the weaker one backs `QUERY`.
//!
//! The fix is narrower than "SLG cannot bind": `is_ref_matches` conflated *not
//! bound* with *bound to NULL*, so an absent subject compared as NULL and
//! matched nothing. The subject branch now distinguishes the two, and
//! `semi_join_is_ref` binds absent subjects from the derived fact — the outer
//! loop was already a cross product, so an IS-ref becomes a generator for free.
//! The negation paths keep the strict comparison (see `SubjectMode`): relaxing
//! them would flip `IS NOT` with an unbindable subject from keep-all to
//! keep-nothing.
//!
//! ## Test-coverage gap that let this ship
//!
//! `uni-locy-tck/tck/features/combinations/SemanticParity.feature` exists and is
//! titled "QUERY Results Must Match Derived Relations ... to catch SLG/fixpoint
//! divergences". Its scenarios cover FOLD, `IS NOT`, PROB and a three-stratum
//! chain — but none had a fresh-binding `IS`-ref, and the recursion feature
//! files contained no `QUERY` at all. The guard was built with a hole in it.
//! That is now closed by a generic parity check in the TCK's `store_result`,
//! which compares derived key tuples against QUERY rows on every scenario.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   cargo nextest run -p uni-db --test integration -E 'test(issue_160)'
