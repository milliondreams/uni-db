"""Assert the Rust surface and the Python bindings have not drifted apart.

Four guards already police the Python bindings, and every one of them compares
Python to Python: `test_sync_async_parity.py` (sync class vs async twin),
`test_stub_drift.py` (runtime vs `__init__.pyi`, both directions), `stubtest`,
and `check_doc_symbols.py`. Nothing compares Rust to Python, so a field or an
error variant added on the Rust side and never bound is not a drift failure --
it is an absence, and absence is exactly what none of those detect.

That is how two defects reached a release. `UniConfig` grew to 40 public fields
while `config({...})` understood 12, and the extractor accepted an unrecognised
key in silence, so `config({"ssi_enabled": False})` asked for a setting, raised
nothing, and did nothing.

This does not demand that every Rust item be bound -- most of the unbound ones
are deliberate. It demands the gap be *written down*. A new field or variant
fails this check until somebody either binds it or adds it to the allowlist
below with a reason, which turns an invisible omission into a reviewed decision.

Exit code 0 = no undeclared drift, 1 = an item is neither bound nor allowlisted.
