## 2. General Execution Pattern

### CALL Syntax

All projection-based algorithms share a common first two arguments:

```cypher
CALL uni.algo.<name>(
    ['NodeLabel1', 'NodeLabel2'],   // nodeLabels: List (required)
    ['REL_TYPE1', 'REL_TYPE2'],     // relationshipTypes: List (required)
    <algorithm-specific args...>     // optional, with defaults
)
YIELD col1, col2, ...
RETURN col1, col2
```

DirectTraversal algorithms (shortestPath, allSimplePaths) use positional arguments instead of nodeLabels/relationshipTypes.

### Execution Modes

**DirectTraversal** -- Zero-copy BFS on AdjacencyManager + L0Buffer. Used for single-source path queries. Fast startup, streaming results, no materialization.

**GraphProjection** -- Materialized dense CSR graph in memory. Used for iterative algorithms (PageRank, WCC, Louvain, betweenness, eigenvector, etc.). Limits: `max_projection_memory` (1 GB default), `max_vertices` (100M default).

## 9. Configuration & Tuning

### Graph Projection Options

Projection-based algorithms automatically build a CSR from the specified labels and types.

| Parameter | Effect |
|---|---|
| `nodeLabels` | Filter to nodes with these labels only |
| `relationshipTypes` | Filter to edges of these types only |
| `weightProperty` | Edge property to use as weight (bellmanFord, kShortestPaths, mst, eigenvector, katz) |
| `capacityProperty` | Edge property for flow capacity (fordFulkerson, maxFlow) |
| `heuristicProperty` | Node property for A* heuristic |

### Projection Limits

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `max_projection_memory` | 1 GB | Maximum memory for a single graph projection |
| `max_vertices` | 100M | Maximum number of vertices in a projection |

### Directed vs. Undirected

Most algorithms (pageRank, wcc, louvain, betweenness, triangleCount, bridges, etc.) include reverse edges automatically to treat the graph as undirected. Algorithms that are inherently directed (scc, topoSort, hasCycle) do not include reverse edges. `degreeCentrality` direction is controlled via the `direction` parameter.

---

## 10. Best Practices

### Algorithm Selection

| Need | Algorithm | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Find one shortest path | `shortestPath` | DirectTraversal, fastest |
| Weighted shortest path | `bellmanFord` or `bidirectionalDijkstra` | bellmanFord handles negative weights |
| Important nodes globally | `pageRank` | Iterative, captures transitive importance |
| Important nodes locally | `betweenness` | Identifies bottlenecks and bridges |
| Cluster membership | `wcc` | Fast, no parameters to tune |
| Community structure | `louvain` | Modularity-optimized, handles overlap |
| Fast community labels | `labelPropagation` | Linear time, good for large graphs |
| Network vulnerabilities | `bridges` + `articulationPoints` | Find single points of failure |
| Dense subgroups | `kCore` or `maximalCliques` | kCore for hierarchy, cliques for exact groups |
| Node-to-node similarity | `nodeSimilarity` | Jaccard/Cosine/Overlap metrics |

### Performance Tips

- **Use DirectTraversal for single-path queries.** shortestPath and allSimplePaths use zero-copy BFS -- much faster than projection-based alternatives for point queries.
- **Project only needed labels/types.** Smaller projection = faster execution + less memory.
- **Set iteration limits.** Always set `maxIterations` and `tolerance` on convergence algorithms (pageRank, eigenvector, katz, louvain) to prevent runaway computation.
- **Use samplingSize for betweenness.** On large graphs, approximate betweenness with `samplingSize` to avoid O(V*E) cost.
- **Prefer maxFlow over fordFulkerson.** Dinic's algorithm (maxFlow) is more efficient for large flow networks.

### Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Full projection for a single path | Wastes memory materializing entire graph | Use `shortestPath` (DirectTraversal) |
| No convergence params on iterative algo | May not converge, wasted compute | Set `maxIterations` and `tolerance` |
| Running on unprojected graph | Processes irrelevant vertices/edges | Always specify `nodeLabels` and `edgeTypes` |
| Using allPairsShortestPath on large graphs | O(V^3) memory and time | Use single-source algorithms instead |

ORDER BY `order` ASC
```

## 12. Guest-Authorable Graph Algorithms (GraphCompute)

Beyond the built-in `uni.algo.*` catalog, third-party algorithms can be authored in a guest language (Rhai, Python/PyO3, WASM, Extism) and run inside the engine as a *conductor* that issues coarse **native kernels** over opaque graph handles. The guest never touches raw storage; it orchestrates O(V+E) native primitives (projection, SpMV, expand, arena / tree-search ops) and reads back only small result tensors. First-party guest algorithms ship under `uni.algo.gc*` (e.g. `uni.algo.gcpagerank`).

### Kernel catalog highlights

Element-wise / map kernels make composite scoring formulas expressible without a bespoke native op — e.g. the UCT exploration term `c * sqrt(ln N / n)` is now composable:

| Kernel | Effect |
|---|---|
| `map_apply(m, "sqrt")` | Element-wise sqrt over a map handle |
| `map_apply(m, "exp")` | Element-wise exp |
| `ewise(a, b, "div")` | Element-wise `a / b`, with `x / 0 = 0` |
| `compare(a, b, "gt")` | Element-wise comparison (`gt`/`ge`/`lt`/`le`/`eq`/`ne`) to a 1.0/0.0 mask; shape-preserving, so an `[E]` comparison yields an `[E]` mask |
| `work_budget()` / `work_spent()` / `work_remaining()` | The native-work meter; reading costs nothing |

### When `node_property` / `edge_property` return NaN

The consumer-facing rule has two halves, and they behave differently:

- A property you **did not request** in the projection spec is an **error**:
  `edge_property: \`w\` was not projected (add it to edgeProperties)`. The
  `nodeProperties` / `edgeProperties` config keys are what make a column exist at
  all — a kernel cannot read a column the projection never materialized.
- A property you **did** request but which has no value for a given element is
  `NaN`, per element, silently. That is deliberate: `NaN` is an honest "no value
  here", distinct from a real `0.0`, and it propagates visibly into `reduce_sum`.

A requested name that is declared on **none** of the projected labels/edge types
*and* resolves for **no** projected element is rejected outright — that is a typo,
not data. A name declared on at least one projected label is accepted across a
heterogeneous projection; the labels that do not carry it yield `NaN`. The same
check covers `weightProperty`, where the old failure mode was worse: an unknown
weight name silently defaulted every edge weight to `1.0`, which is
indistinguishable from real data.

So, after that check, the remaining ways to see `NaN` are:

| Cause | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Heterogeneous projection | The element's label does not declare the property. |
| Non-numeric value | Only `Float` and `Int` convert; `Bool`, `String`, `Null` and `Bytes` all read `NaN`. |
| Deleted element | A tombstone in a newer L0 generation removes the entry. |
| Time-travel pin | A pinned snapshot drops entries above its version high-water mark. |

Two related contracts worth knowing:

- **Cypher / Named projections carry no property columns at all**, so
  `node_property` / `edge_property` against one always *error* — they never return
  `NaN`. Use a label/edge-type-scoped projection when you need property tensors.
- **Edge weight is not an edge property.** A missing weight falls back to `1.0`
  (the traversal default), never `NaN`.

### Composing operations the catalog does not name

The kernel set is deliberately coarse and the op vocabularies are closed, so `ewise` has no
`gt` and `map_apply` has no `step`. That does **not** mean thresholds and conditionals are out
of reach: `map_to_set` carries a closed predicate enum and `set_to_map` lifts the resulting
bitset back to a `[V]` map, which composes with `ewise mul` into an ordinary masked blend.

Ask for an op that is not in a vocabulary and the engine answers with the remedy:

```
bad ewise op `gt` — elementwise comparison is composable: compare(a, b, "gt");
valid ewise ops: add, mul, min, max, axpy, div
```

| You wanted | Compose it as |
| --- | --- |
| `a > b` (also `ge`/`lt`/`le`/`eq`/`ne`) | `compare(a, b, "gt")` — a kernel since 3.0; the older `set_to_map(map_to_set(...))` composition still works but costs three passes of the work meter |
| `step(a, theta)` / `heaviside` | `set_to_map(map_to_set(a, "gt", theta), 1.0)` |
| `select(m, a, b)` | `ewise(b, ewise(m, ewise(a, b, "axpy", -1.0), "mul"), "add")` |
| `a - b` | `ewise(a, b, "axpy", -1.0)` |
| `a - c` (constant) | `map_apply(a, "affine", 1.0, -c)` |
| `relu(a)` | `ewise(a, set_to_map(map_to_set(a, "gt", 0.0), 1.0), "mul")` |
| `abs(a)` | `ewise(a, map_apply(a, "scale", -1.0), "max")` |
| `clip(a, lo, hi)` | `ewise(ewise(a, lo, "max"), hi, "min")` |
| `a ** 2`, integer powers | `repeat ewise(x, x, "mul"); x squared is ewise(a, a, "mul")` |
| `-a` | `map_apply(a, "scale", -1.0)` |
| `normalize(m)` | `map_apply(m, "normalize_l1") or map_apply(m, "normalize_l2")` |
| an exact edge mask (edge-type / class selector) | `edge_mask_window(edge_property(g, prop), 0.5, 1.5)` — deterministic, no RNG. `sample_edges(sel, seed, iter)` yields the same mask because `prob = 0.0` never fires and `prob = 1.0` always does, **for every seed** — that endpoint behaviour is a guarantee, not an accident. Prefer the window: it says what it means. |

Two caveats worth knowing before you rely on them:

- **The `select` blend poisons on NaN.** `0.0 * NaN = NaN`, so a NaN in the *unselected* branch
  propagates. Where either branch may be NaN, `scatter` over the `VertexSet` instead of
  multiplying by its lowered mask.
- **A composed comparison charges the native-work meter three times** (`ewise` + `map_to_set` +
  `set_to_map`, each `|V|`), where a primitive comparison would charge once.

These identities are executed against an independent scalar oracle on every CI run
(`composition_recipes.rs`), so a recipe that stops being true breaks the build rather than
quietly misleading you.

Arena — the tree-search substrate, now **11 kernels**:

| Kernel | Effect |
|---|---|
| `arena_backup(arena, value_col, leaves, deltas)` | Value backprop along each leaf's **full root path** (general-depth UCT, not just depth-1). |
| `arena_descend(...)` | Selection descent. The virtual-loss (`vloss`) term is a flat linear score offset applied in the descent loop — **not** a per-visit UCB recompute. Run at `vloss = 0` for parity with a Python-engine reference. |

Reachability and sampled expansion:

| Kernel | Effect |
|---|---|
| `reach_fixpoint(g, seeds, dir)` | BFS-to-fixpoint reachable set in one native O(V+E) call. |
| `expand_sampled(g, frontier, dir, exclude, prob, seed, iter)` | Fused frontier-scoped lazy sampled expansion — draws only the frontier's out-edges (out-only), applying the per-edge Bernoulli `prob` inline. |
| `sample_edges_undirected(g, prob, seed, iter)` | Both half-edges of an undirected pair share one Bernoulli draw (canonical `(min, max)` key). Simple undirected graphs only. |

Direction `"both"` — `expand`, `degrees`, and `spmv` accept `dir: "both"` (union of out + in edges). This **requires `includeReverse: true` in the projection config, or it errors** (fail-loud). `spmv` with `"both"` is unweighted.

### Argument typing

A guest algorithm's declared manifest `args` are now type- and arity-checked before the provider runs (previously the declaration was ignored). Tokens:

| Token | Accepts |
|---|---|
| `value` / `cypherValue` | A scalar **or** an array — e.g. a variable-length seed set |
| `list` / `array` | An array/list argument |
| `int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`, ... | The corresponding primitive |

A guest declaring `args: ["value"]` can be called with a Cypher list directly — no per-arity codegen:

```cypher
CALL p.spread([1, 2, 3], {nodeLabels: ['N'], edgeTypes: ['E']})
```

The trailing projection-config object (`{nodeLabels, edgeTypes, includeReverse, projectAll, ...}`) is an implicit optional last argument on every guest algorithm — it need not be declared in `args`.

### Projection scoping is fail-loud (breaking change)

An **unscoped** projection — no `nodeLabels` and no `edgeTypes` — now **errors** instead of silently projecting the whole graph. To project the entire graph, name the labels/types or set `projectAll: true` explicitly. First-party `uni.algo.gc*` procedures opt into whole-graph projection automatically.

Additional fail-loud guarantees:
- `emit` names the fault at the guest's call: a column from the wrong projection is rejected by identity, and a wrong-length column by length.
- A whole-graph projection errors on undeclared (schemaless) labels.
- Stored property values now read correctly from **unflushed in-memory L0** — previously a projection built before a flush saw `NaN` values / default edge weight `1.0`.

### Value identity: shape and index space

Every value carries the **shape** it was built with (`[V]` or `[E]`) and the **index space** its
slots belong to — the projection or arena it came from. Both are enforced, so a `[V]` map cannot
combine with an `[E]` tensor of equal length, and values from two projections cannot combine at
all (slot `i` names a different vertex in each). `ewise`, `map_apply`, `compare` and
`segmented_reduce` preserve both, so an `[E]` pipeline stays `[E]` through to `sample_edges`.

Sets, walk matrices and pair lists are tagged too, so a foreign operand is rejected wherever one
meets a graph or another set: the set algebra, `expand` / `expand_masked` / `expand_sampled`
(frontier, `exclude` **and** edge mask), `spmv` / `spmv_masked`, `scatter`, a masked `reduce`,
`walk_visit_counts`, and `sample_edges_undirected`. The `exclude` case matters most:
`reach_fixpoint` passes the visited-set as `exclude` every iteration, so a foreign one silently
under-expands the traversal instead of failing.

`set_to_map` therefore **inherits** its set's space. *Unknown* survives only as the permissive
element of unification — nothing a guest can build lands there. `map_to_set` is shape-polymorphic:
an `[E]` tensor lowers to an `EdgeSet` that `spmv_masked` accepts.

A guest can pre-declare extra projections at the CALL site with a `scopes` map
(`{nodeLabels: [...], scopes: {agg: {nodeLabels: [...], edgeTypes: [...]}}}`) and reach them with
`gc.graph_named("agg")`. Scopes are built by the host before the guest runs — `graph_named` is a
lookup, so a guest cannot project in a loop and escape the work meter — and the size-derived work
budget is summed across every bound projection. Each scope takes the full config vocabulary
independently, Native or Cypher/Named. Slot correspondence between projections is a **Native-only**
guarantee: `ProjectionBuilder` sorts and dedups vids, `GraphProjection::from_rows` does not.

To combine values across scopes, use `rekey(value, g)`. It is a *verified* move, not a cast: it
walks both slot→Vid maps and fails naming the first divergent slot unless the projections describe
the same vertices. `[V]` tensors and vertex sets only — `[E]` values have no cross-projection
meaning.

Egress is keyed to the value: `topk`, `arg_extreme`, `emit_walks` and `emit_pairs` return the vids
of *their own* value's projection, not the first graph bound; an arena-keyed value is rejected.
`emit` checks identity before length, so a wrong-projection column is named as such.

### The native-work budget

Every invocation gets a finite budget of *native-work units*, and each kernel
charges roughly the work it does. Exceeding it aborts the CALL with `0x865`
(`GraphComputeIncomplete`, reason `Exhausted`) — never a silently truncated result.

**The default is `min(10_000 x (|V| + |E| + 1), 1_000_000_000)`.** Both `|V|` and
`|E|` appear because the meter charges the `O(V)` kernels as well as the `O(E)`
ones. The absolute ceiling binds above roughly 100k projected elements, so the
linear term alone is not the whole rule.

A `GraphComputeWork` capability grant **replaces** that default rather than
raising it — an explicit grant is authoritative in both directions.

**What each kernel charges:**

| Kernel family | Charge |
| --- | --- |
| `spmv`, `spmv_masked`, `edge_weights`, `edges_all` | `|E|` |
| `expand`, `expand_masked`, `expand_sampled` | the frontier's total degree |
| `sample_edges`, `sample_edges_undirected` | `|E|`, checked in chunks |
| `degrees`, `vertex_ids`, `ewise`, `compare`, `map_apply`, `reduce_sum`, `reduce_sum_masked`, `zero_map`, `scatter`, `set_to_map`, `map_to_set`, `l1_diff`, `arg_extreme`, `topk`, `next_bucket`, `node_property`, `edge_property`, `segmented_reduce`, `edge_mask_window` | one unit per element |
| `frontier` | one unit per seed |
| `rekey` | `|V|` — it walks both projections' slot→Vid maps to verify the correspondence |
| `set_union` / `set_diff` / `set_intersect` | one unit per 64-bit *word*, not per element |
| `emit` | `rows x columns` |
| `random_walks`, `walk_visit_counts`, `emit_walks` | total steps |
| `neighborhood_overlap`, `all_pairs_overlap` | work done, at least `|V|` |
| arena kernels | their own footprint (capacity, path length, or neighbours touched) |
| `work_budget` / `work_spent` / `work_remaining`, `set_len`, `is_empty`, `free`, `vertex_count`, `edge_count` | nothing |

Expensive kernels re-check mid-loop, so a single celebrity-vertex `expand` cannot
blow past the cap. Batching amortizes the boundary crossing but never the meter:
a batched kernel charges the same as the calls it replaces.

**Reading the meter from a guest:**

```rhai
let left = gc.work_remaining();   // free; so are work_budget and work_spent
```

Sizing work ahead of a run is better done from the formula than from the meter:
branching on `work_remaining()` makes a kernel's *result* depend on the capability
grant, so the same program under two grants can return different answers. That
does not violate the determinism contract, which is per-configuration, but it does
forfeit cross-grant reproducibility — and a differential oracle would see it as
drift. Discovering the ceiling by deliberately triggering aborted CALLs is never
necessary: it is a pure function of `|V|` and `|E|`.

### Tracing handle resolutions

Setting `UNI_GC_TRACE` makes a session remember its recent handle resolutions, and
attaches them to any handle error it raises:

```
GraphComputeError: stale handle [gc-trace, oldest first, epoch:kind:gen:slot —
0007:1:000:0 0007:2:000:1 0007:1:001:0]
```

The trace is bounded (the tail leading up to a failure, not the whole history) and
rides the error rather than a separate log, so it reaches whoever ran the query
without any extra plumbing. It is recorded at the point every loader shares, so a
Rhai guest is covered as well as the sandboxed ones.

It is always compiled and inert unless the variable is set — with it unset,
nothing is recorded and error messages are byte-identical. That is deliberate:
diagnostics you cannot switch on in an already-shipped build are no help against a
problem that only appears in production.
