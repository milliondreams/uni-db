# Pharmaceutical Batch Genealogy and Intervention Planning

**Industry**: Pharmaceutical Manufacturing | **Role**: VP Quality, Head of Manufacturing Operations | **Time to value**: 4 hours

## The Problem

A deviation is found in a batch of active pharmaceutical ingredient. Every downstream batch that incorporated that material — and every batch made from those batches — is potentially affected. Identifying the full impact, assessing risk, and deciding which batches to quarantine, retest, or release is a regulatory obligation under 21 CFR Part 211 and EU GMP Annex 15. Getting it wrong means either a costly over-recall or an FDA warning letter.

## The Traditional Approach

Quality teams trace batch genealogy through MES batch records, often across multiple systems for different manufacturing stages. A single API batch may feed 8-12 formulation batches, each producing 3-5 packaging lots. Tracing this tree manually takes 2-4 days. Risk assessment is done in spreadsheets, with quality reviewers assigning impact scores by judgment. Intervention decisions — quarantine, retest, or release — are made batch by batch, balancing risk against cost and supply continuity. The entire process is documented in Word files for regulatory submission.

## With Uni

The notebook defines recursive campaign lineage traversal: starting from the deviated batch, Uni traces every downstream batch through campaign genealogy (`NEXT_BATCH`) paths, carrying risk along each path with `ALONG`. Risk accumulates through the genealogy — batches farther from the deviation accrue per-edge carry risk on top of process risk, so distance from the deviation drives the score. Intervention selection is cost-optimized with a dual priority via `BEST BY`: minimize residual risk first, then minimize cost among equally safe options. A counterfactual `ASSUME` scenario and an `ABDUCE` minimal-change search test containment, and `EXPLAIN RULE` produces a derivation trace for any conclusion as ready-made evidence for regulatory submission. The model is a handful of declarative Locy rules covering lineage, risk propagation, intervention costing, and optimal selection.

## What You'll See

- Complete batch genealogy from the deviated source through every downstream campaign batch, with no manual tracing
- Risk-ranked impacted batches with scores derived from genealogy distance (hops) and per-edge carry risk
- Optimal intervention plan: quarantine, retest, or release for each batch, selected risk-first then cost-second
- Counterfactual containment (`ASSUME`) and minimal-change (`ABDUCE`) analysis, plus a derivation trace (`EXPLAIN RULE`) for inclusion in regulatory deviation reports

## Why It Matters

A pharmaceutical recall costs $10-50M on average and takes months to resolve. Reducing genealogy tracing from days to minutes and replacing judgment-based intervention with optimized, evidence-backed decisions protects both patients and the business.
