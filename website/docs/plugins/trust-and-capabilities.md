# Trust & Capabilities

The host security model for plugins answers two independent questions. **Trust**
decides *whether, and whose,* code is allowed to load at all — by checking
manifest signatures, signing-key roots, and content hash-pins. **Capabilities**
decide *what a plugin, once loaded, is permitted to do* — the grant set that
gates each extension surface and host import, plus the resource quotas that bound
its execution.

These are deliberately separate axes. A plugin can be fully trusted (signed by a
key in your root) and still be granted nothing but a single scalar-function
surface; conversely, an unsigned plugin loaded under a permissive policy is still
subject to the capability set you grant it. This page covers both, and is precise
about what is enforced today versus deferred — see the [Scope note](#scope-note).

For the broader model, see [Concepts](concepts.md); for exact type signatures,
see [Reference](reference.md); for the per-loader details, see
[Loaders](loaders/index.md).

## Trust vs capabilities

| Concern | Question | Mechanism | Configured on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Trust** | Whether/whom to load | Signature policy, trust root, hash-pin | The host builder (`plugin_trust`) |
| **Capabilities** | What a loaded plugin may do | Grant set (`effective = declared ∩ granted`), quotas | The load call (`grants=[...]`) |

Trust is a per-instance, host-level decision: one signature policy and one trust
root govern the whole `Uni` instance. Capabilities are a per-load decision: every
plugin you load is granted its own set, and two loads of the same artifact may be
granted differently.

## Signature policy

`SignaturePolicy` (in `uni-plugin`, `crates/uni-plugin/src/verify.rs`) has three
levels, dialled up over time without changing call sites:

- **`Disabled`** — the default. Signature checks are skipped entirely; signed and
  unsigned manifests both pass *without inspection*. This is the back-compatible
  v1 behavior.
- **`WarnIfUnsigned`** — runs the verifier. A manifest with a signature is
  verified against the trust root; a manifest *without* one is accepted but emits
  a `tracing::warn!`. Use this to observe your plugin surface before enforcing.
- **`RequireSigned`** — runs the verifier and rejects anything that is not
  validly signed: an unsigned manifest, a signature whose `key_id` is not in the
  trust root, or a bad signature all produce a `PluginError`.

The host sets the policy on the builder via `plugin_trust`. Because the trust
config is a builder-level runtime object (see below), this is Rust-side
configuration; loaders called from Python inherit whatever the instance was built
with.

=== "Rust"

    ```rust
    use std::sync::Arc;
    use uni_db::Uni;
    use uni_db::api::plugin_trust::PluginTrustConfig;
    use uni_plugin::verify::{SignaturePolicy, TrustRoot};

    let mut root = TrustRoot::new();
    root.allow_with_key("release-2026", release_pubkey_bytes); // [u8; 32]

    let db = Uni::open("./db")
        .plugin_trust(PluginTrustConfig::new(
            SignaturePolicy::RequireSigned,
            root,
        ))
        .build()
        .await?;
    ```

    The default — equivalent to omitting `plugin_trust` entirely — is
    `SignaturePolicy::Disabled` with an empty trust root, which accepts every
    plugin. `PluginTrustConfig::default()` constructs exactly that.

## Trust root & keys

A `TrustRoot` is the set of signing keys the host accepts. You build it
explicitly:

```rust
let mut root = TrustRoot::new();
root.allow_with_key("ops@example.com", pubkey_bytes); // 32-byte Ed25519 key
```

`allow_with_key(key_id, public_key)` binds a key id to its 32-byte Ed25519 public
key; the related `allow(key_id)` adds a key id *without* key material, which is
useful for shape-only verification and tests. Cryptographic verification of a
signed manifest (`verify_signed_manifest` / `verify_ed25519`) happens under the
default-on `ed25519` Cargo feature; with that feature disabled, the verifier
falls back to checking signature shape and trust-root membership only.

### Why it is not in `UniConfig`

`TrustRoot` holds raw public-key material and is intentionally **neither `Clone`
nor `Serialize`**. The serializable `UniConfig` is cloned into every session and
fork, so a non-`Clone`, non-`Serialize` object cannot live there. If you go
looking for a `trust_root` field in [Configuration](../reference/configuration.md),
you will not find one — by design.

Instead the trust policy is a *builder-level runtime object*: you pass
`PluginTrustConfig` to `UniBuilder::plugin_trust`, it is stored on the instance's
internal state (`UniInner`), wrapped in an `Arc` so it can be shared across
`at_snapshot` / `at_fork` clones, and consulted at every plugin-load site. There
is intentionally no global, serializable plugin-config struct.

## Grants & capabilities

A loaded plugin's authority is its **effective capability set**, which is the
intersection of what its manifest *declares* and what the host *grants*:

```text
effective = declared ∩ granted
```

A capability the plugin never declared cannot be granted into existence, and a
capability the host did not grant is stripped even if declared. On the load APIs,
the `grants` argument is a list of capability *name* strings. The recognized
names are:

| Grant | Surface |
| --- | --- |
| `ScalarFn` | Register Cypher scalar functions |
| `AggregateFn` | Register Cypher aggregate functions |
| `Procedure` | Register Cypher procedures (read-only) |
| `Filesystem` | Filesystem read/write host import |
| `Network` | HTTP/TCP egress host import |
| `HostQuery` | Query back into the host session |
| `Kms` | KMS sign/verify host import |
| `Secret` | Acquire named secret handles |

### How withheld capabilities take effect

- **Registration surfaces** — a registrar method (e.g. `scalar_fn`) is rejected
  with `PluginError::CapabilityRequired` when the corresponding capability is not
  in the effective set. This applies to every loader.
- **Extism** — the host-function set is filtered at load: only the host functions
  for granted capabilities are linked into the plugin.
- **WASM Component Model** — the loader computes the effective set and reports it
  as `effective_capabilities` / `denied_capabilities`. The capability-gated
  `host-net` import (HTTP GET/POST) is added to the linker only when `Network` is
  granted — a plugin importing it without the grant fails at link time. The
  always-available `host-log` and `host-trace-context` imports are linked
  unconditionally. (`host-fs` is not yet exposed on the Component Model; on Extism
  filesystem/query/KMS/secret host functions are wired — see below.)

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from uni_db import Uni

    db = Uni.open("./db")

    with open("geo_component.wasm", "rb") as f:
        outcome = db.load_wasm_component(f.read(), grants=["ScalarFn"])

    # Extism plugins use the same grants list:
    with open("geo_extism.wasm", "rb") as f:
        outcome = db.load_wasm_extism(f.read(), grants=["ScalarFn"])
    ```

    Passing `grants=["ScalarFn"]` grants exactly the scalar-function surface and
    nothing else — no network, filesystem, or host-query host imports are linked.
    The Python bindings currently expose the coarse capability *variants*; the
    narrowed forms (specific path globs for `Filesystem`, URL globs for
    `Network`) are configured Rust-side.

## Quotas

Per-call resource limits are applied at load:

| Limit | Bounds |
| --- | --- |
| `FuelPerCall` | Maximum fuel / operations consumed per call |
| `MemoryBytes` | Maximum linear memory per instance |

The Rhai engine enforces these from the granted quota capabilities; the WASM
Component Model and Extism loaders take the equivalent fuel/memory limits from
their manifest fields. There is intentionally **no global `PluginConfig`**
struct — per-load grants and limits are the only knobs.

## Scope note

!!! warning "Signature enforcement is wired today only on the `add_plugin` path"

    The signature policy and trust root described above are enforced **today only
    on the compile-time `add_plugin` path** — the path the wiring tests exercise
    (`Disabled` accepts unsigned, `RequireSigned` rejects unsigned,
    `WarnIfUnsigned` accepts and warns).

    The sandboxed loader manifest formats — `ComponentManifest` for WASM Component
    Model and `ExtismPluginManifest` for Extism — **do not yet carry signature
    fields**. Until they do, signature enforcement on WASM, Extism, Rhai, and
    Python *loads* is **deferred (Phase D)**, and sandboxed loads carry no
    artifact-integrity check.

    Capability *grants*, by contrast, take effect on the sandboxed load path
    today: registrar surfaces reject ungranted registrations, and the Extism
    loader links only the host functions for granted capabilities (see
    [Grants & capabilities](#grants-capabilities)).
